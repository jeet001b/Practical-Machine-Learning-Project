# Activity Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict human activity based on data collected from wearable devices like Fitbit, Nike FuelBand, and Jawbone Up.
With the help of machine learning models, the goal is to classify different user behaviors and movements using real-world sensor data.
